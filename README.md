A repo for my public, personal website

This site is currently hosted on a free server, so if there are any issues, please note I plan on upgrading to a paid site.

## Known Bugs & Desired Feature Improvements

### Wikipedia App
1. Hitting enter after entering a search parameter clears the field instead of searching.

### Quotes
1. API no longer works correctly.

### Photos
1. Add new photos.

### Design
1. Come up with fresh new design.

### Calculator
1. The calculator should be able to perform calculations on the secondary display. 5+5 = 10. 10 is now on the secondary display, but if you type -3, and then hit enter, the secondary display will be updated to -3, not 7.

### Calculator App
1. Fixed bug where you could type unlimited leading zeros
2. Fixed a bug where you couldn't type a negative number
