A repo for my public, personal website

This site is currently hosted on a free server, so if there are any issues, please note I plan on upgrading to a paid site very soon.

## Known Bugs

### Wikipedia App
1. Hitting enter after entering a search parameter clears the field instead of searching.

### Calculator App
1. Not currently possible to have a negative number start an expression.
2. Clicking 0 as the first digit of a number continues to add more. It should
   check if the leading digit is a 0 and there is no decimal, and if so, don't add another. 
3. Unable to create decimals if the first number isn't explictly zero.
4. Unable to clear history

## Planned Feature Improvements

### Calculator App
1. Full scientific calculator

### Twitch App
1. Better design

### Pomodoro Timer
1. Better color scheme
