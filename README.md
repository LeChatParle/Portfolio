# Portfolio
A repo for my public, personal website

This site is currently hosted on a free server, so if there are any issues, please note I plan on upgrading to a paid site very soon.

#Known Bugs

#Wikipedia App
1. Hitting enter after entering a search parameter clears the field instead of searching.
2. If you search for a second parameter after a first one, the link doesn't dynamically update, and links to the old search result.

#Calculator App
1. If a number starts with a zero, many issues occur.
